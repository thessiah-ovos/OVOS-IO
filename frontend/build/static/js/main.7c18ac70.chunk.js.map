The Instrumental has already been tagged for Content Identification (as that term is used in the music industry) by Licensor as a pre-emptive measure to protect all interested parties in the Master Recording.

Upon Licensor’s exercise of the option, Licensee must immediately remove the New Song from any and all digital and physical distribution channels and must immediately cease access to any streams and/or downloads of the New Song by the general public. </li>\n        </ol>\n        <br>\n      </li>\n\n<!-- BREACH -->\n\n      <li><b>BREACH.</b>\n        <ol><p></p>\n          <li type=\"a\">The Licensee shall have five (5) business days from its receipt of written notice by the Licensor and/or Licensor’s authorized representative to cure any alleged breach of this Agreement by Licensee.

Accordingly, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Licensee of the provisions of this Agreement, Licensor may seek and shall be entitled to a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction restraining the Licensee from violating the provisions of this Agreement. Nothing herein shall prohibit the Licensor from pursuing any other available legal or equitable remedy from such breach or threatened breach, including but not limited to the recovery of damages from the Licensee.
