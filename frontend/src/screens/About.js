        <div className="about-container">Thessian Sound Company Limited, established on the 1st of January 2020, is an independent record company and privately-held entity situated in St. Andrew, Jamaica W.I. that is governed and protected by the laws of Jamaica. 
            Thessian Sound LLC was developed by its founder and director Shaquille Blackwood (Thessiah) in efforts to develop a unique sound for himself as a musical artist and record producer. 
            In the process, Thessian Sound LLC has evolved into an entity that not only develops the sounds of its artists and producers; but helps to sculpt and develop a unique sound for all new artists and producers who are aspiring to enter into the professional world of music business to make a difference. Thessian Sound LLC also extends its reach to veteran artists and producers who are looking towards rebranding to create a sonically fresh image for their existing fan bases and future listeners.
