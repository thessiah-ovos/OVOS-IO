The Instrumental has already been tagged for Content Identification (as that term is used in the music industry) by Licensor as a pre-emptive measure to protect all interested parties in the Master Recording.

          <li type="a">Licensee recognizes and agrees that a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by Licensee give rise to irreparable injury to the Licensor, which may not be adequately compensated by damages. Accordingly, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Licensee of the provisions of this Agreement, Licensor may seek and shall be entitled to a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction restraining the Licensee from violating the provisions of this Agreement.
